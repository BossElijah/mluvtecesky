                    <h2 class="important">Rights and Obligations</h2>

<p>A foreign person participating in the Czech public health insurance program, in accordance with Act No. 48/1997 Coll., on public health insurance and on changes to certain related laws, as last amended, has the following rights and obligations.</p>

<h3>Rights of an individual participating in the public health insurance program:</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Choice of a health insurance company: ,an individual’s choice of a health insurance company can be changed every 12 months – always and only as of January, 1st of the following calendar year. The insured (or his/her legal representative/guardian) submits an application to the selected health insurance company no later than 6 months before the requested date of change. Only one application for a change of one’s health insurance company as of January,  1st can be submitted for any given calendar year. If more than one health insurance company application is submitted, these other applications will not be considered, even if they were filed within the prescribed period;</li>
	<li>Choice of a health care services provider (hereinafter referred to as "provider"), which has a contract with his/her respective health insurance company. The insured person has the right to choose the medical institution of the provider; in case of a registered provider, the right can be applied once every three months,</li>
	<li>Timely and local availability: this relates to the insured person’s right of access to covered services provided by the health insurance company’s contracted providers,</li>
	<li>Provision of covered services: the insured person’s right to the covered services to the extent and under the conditions provided for under the law, where the provider may not accept any non-required reimbursement from the insured person for these covered services,</li>
	<li>Medicines (drugs) and foods for special medical purposes: the insured person’s right to receive such items without direct payment, in the case of medicines and foods for special medical purposes, as covered by his/her health insurance company and prescribed in accordance with the law. This right to receive the respective items applies even in situations in which the respective pharmacy has yet to enter into a contract with the health insurance company of the insured person,</li>
	<li>Access to information from his/her health insurance company: on the covered services provided to the insured person,</li>
	<li>Checking up on the health care provided and covered by the health insurance company,</li>
	<li>Receipts for any regulatory fee paid: upon request, the provider is required to issue a receipt to the insured person paying such a fee,</li>
	<li>Receipt for the payment of any required addition charges: as paid by the insured person for only partially insurance covered medical products or foods for special medical purposes, which were received from a pharmacy. Upon request, the pharmacy is required to issue this type of document to the insured person,</li>
	<li>For the payment of the amount exceeding the limit: to make payment of the regulatory fees and additional charges, which are to be paid for only partially insurance covered prescribed medicines or foods for special medical purposes, within the deadlines called for under the law.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Obligations of the participating person in the public health insurance program:</h3>

<ol>
	<li>to inform the respective health insurance company about his/her personal information whenever they change,</li>
	<li>on the start date of new employment, the insured person must let the employer know about the identity of the employee’s current health insurance company. This same obligation also applies in situations in which the employee changes their health insurance company during the term of their employment. This obligation needs to be complied with within eight (8) days from the date of changing one’s health insurance company. The employer must confirm in writing the receipt of the notifications described above. The employer has the right to require the employee (or former employee) to pay any penalties incurred by the employer in connection with an insured person’s failure to properly notify his/her employer about a change in his/her health insurance company or a failure to properly provide such a notification within the required deadlines,</li>
	<li>to pay the required insurance premiums to the respective health insurance company – unless otherwise provided for under this Act,</li>
	<li>to cooperate in the receipt of the provided health care services and any checking up on the progress of the individual treatment procedure(s) and to follow the established treatment regimen, as set by the healthcare provider,</li>
	<li>upon being given the opportunity to do so, to undergo preventive examinations – where so provided for under this Act or other generally binding legal regulations,</li>
	<li>to comply with measures to prevent disease,</li>
	<li>to avoid activities which would deliberately damage or harm his/her health,</li>
	<li>to identify himself/herself, when seeking health care services, using a valid insurance card or substitute document issued by the respective health insurance company, except for when receiving medicinal products, foods for special medical purposes and medical devices,</li>
	<li>to report the loss or damage of his/her health insurance card to his/her health insurance company within eight (8) days of discovering it lost or missing,</li>
	<li>to return his/her insurance card to his/her health insurance company within eight (8) days in case of:		<ul>
			<li>the termination of the health insurance,</li>
			<li>a change of health insurance company;</li>
			<li>a long-term stay abroad,</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>to notify the respective health insurance company of any changes to the insured person’s first name, surname, permanent address or birth number. This notification must take place within thirty (30) days from the date of the change. If the insured person is not staying in their registered place of permanent residence, the insured person must notify their health insurance company about the address in the Czech Republic, where he/she lives most of the time,</li>
	<li>when a self-employed person is changing his/her health insurance company, the applicant must submit to his/her newly selected health insurance company documentation on the amount of his/her advance premium payments, as calculated using the applicable premium assessment schedule,</li>
	<li>to pay the provider of health care services the required regulatory fees,</li>
	<li>to reimburse the provider or another entity which provided the insured person with health care services any difference between the cost of the health care services provided and the amount reimbursed the provider by the health insurance company.</li>
</ol>

<p>A failure to comply with the obligation to pay health insurance premiums does not terminate the insured person’s relationship with his/her health insurance company. Such a failure to pay premiums also does not mean a loss of the entitlement of the insured person to receive health care services. Instead, for any non-payment of premiums, the health insurance will assess a penalty and take the appropriate steps to recover from the insured person this penalty, along with any outstanding premiums.</p>
<p>If a foreign person or one of his/her relatives should become a health care patient, he/she should know that they have certain rights and obligations under Act No. 372/2011 Coll. on health services and the terms and conditions for the providing of such services, as last amended.</p>

	<li>The patient has the right to receive health care services at an appropriate level of expertise.</li>
	<li>Being provided by medical services, the patient has the following rights:		<ul>

			<li>to have a close relative or other person designated to act on their behalf by the patient be present; in accordance with any other applicable laws and the internal rules of the medical facility and as long as the presence of such a person does not disrupt the providing of the respective health care services; this right does not apply to persons in custody, imprisonment or security detention,

			<li>to receive, in the health care facility of the provider of inpatient or one-day care services, spiritual support from churches and religious communities registered in the Czech Republic or from persons involved in religious activities (hereinafter referred to as "spiritual/church person"). This support must be provided in accordance with the internal rules of the health care provider and in a manner which does not infringe on the rights of other patients and in a manner respectful of the patient’s health condition, unless another law otherwise provides; the visit of a spiritual/church person cannot be denied to a patient in life threatening situations or if there is a serious risk to a patient’s health – unless other legislation otherwise provides,</li>
			<li>to have his/her health care services provided to him/her in an environment as minimally restrictive as possible and which does not interfere with the needed quality and safety of the services being provided,</li>

	<li>to choose the provider of health care services and to choose the respective medical facility.</li>
</ol>

	<li>not to drink alcohol and to not use any other addictive substances during hospitalization, and upon the decision of the attending physician, to undergo an examination to establish whether the patient is under the influence of alcohol or any other type of addictive substances.</li>
