We reserve the right to legal action in the case of the unsolicited distribution of promotional information, such as spam e-mails.</p>


            <h2>Information collected by us</h2>

            <p>Some of our services can be used without registration on the website. However, to be able to make use of all the features of the website, you must create an account.</p>

            <p>In order for our services to function, we need to collect certain personal information during registration and process it. This Information consists of the following data:</p>


            <ul>
                <li>Username</li>
                <li>E-mail address</li>
                <li>Password</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your e-mail address and password are never visible to other users. We will not disclose this data to third parties and / or provide it to them in any other way.</p>

            <p>The following user registry data are always fully visible to other registered users:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Username</li>
                <li>Date of registration on the website</li>
                <li>Date of last login</li>

            <p>Some other information about you may be stored, for example, if you enter additional data in your personal profile, or if you communicate with the administrators of the website. Providing this information happens purely on a voluntary basis.</p>

            <p>The following personal data will be visible to other users, if you enter them, in addition to the required information, in your personal profile:</p>

Some of this data may be visible to other users, for example in the form of accumulated points.</p>

            <p>As a registered user you can send private messages to other users.
